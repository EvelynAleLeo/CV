## Evelyn Blázquez

I am a very positive, team player, servant leader, open-minded and trustworthy person, very comfortable to work with. I have always been involved in projects that have required great initiative, therefore self-motivation to achieve my goals has become one of my core skills. I am looking for a new career in Software Development. What is most important to me is the working environment, I need to be surrounded by positive and inspiring people.
